# Blot Bot Core Library
This is the repository containing the core library of the Blot Bot drawing machine (aka `bbcore`)
<br>
<br>
It provides a direct interface to drawing with the custom Blot Bot firmware, and so can be tacked on-to any frontend, such as a website, desktop app or CLI. I am actively using this library to produce a desktop app for the Blot Bot.
<br>
<br>
The library provides many utilities for working with Blot Bot.<br>To name a few:
- a modular drawing framework
- drawing method implementations
- a drawing preview generator
- heavy abstractions for controlling the pen
- a socket client to interact with the blot bot firmware
